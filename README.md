# matlab-mass-spring-damper-network-deformable-object
Simulation of deformable objects in MATLAB using mass-spring-damper network.

See the demo video:

New example:  
Universitas Pertamina's logo is modeled as interconnected masses. A simple neighbor search is performed to build the interconnections. There is no fixed mass, and all masses are free to move. Simple contacts occur between the masses, the left wall, the right wall, and the floor (see free_falling_universitas_pertamina_logo folder).
