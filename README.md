# matlab-mass-spring-damper-network-deformable-object
Simulation of deformable objects in MATLAB using mass-spring-damper network.

See the demo video:

New example:  
Universitas Pertamina's logo modeled as interconnected masses. All masses are interconnected. There are no fixed mass. All masses are free to move. Simple contacts occurs btween the masses and the left wall, the right wall, and the floor.
